## üìå How to Integrate JS2PY into Your Project

To use JS2PY in your own web project, simply add the following line of code inside the `<head>` tag of your HTML document:

```html
<script src="https://xpdevs.github.io/JS2PY/data/data.json"></script>

üñ•Ô∏è Adding the GUI

To integrate the GUI into your project, use the following HTML:

<textarea id="inputJs" placeholder="Enter your JavaScript code here..."></textarea>
<button onclick="convertToPython()">Convert to Python</button>
<pre id="output"></pre>

You can also add CSS to improve its design. Here‚Äôs an example:

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    padding: 20px;
}
textarea {
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    font-size: 14px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
button {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
button:hover {
    background-color: #45a049;
}
#output {
    background-color: #fff;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    font-family: monospace;
}

üîÑ Example Conversion

JavaScript Code:

const name = prompt("What's your name?");
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

Converted Python Code:

name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
